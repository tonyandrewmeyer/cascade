"""Command implementations for Cascade."""

# TODO: The auto registration should avoid so much duplication here,
# but the tests aren't working with that properly. It also really
# confuses Claude, so either I need to stop 'Clauding' or find some
# way around that. For now, live with the duplication.

# TODO: Also! Now that I've moved all the commands into separate modules,
# this should be easier still. But I do need to figure out what the
# exported names should be for each of the groups.
